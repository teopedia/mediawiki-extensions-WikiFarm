v2.0   2012.02.18

* The power of MediaWiki API was realized and code of all modules had to be rewrited. So most everything is new in WikiFarm v2.0. Something I want to highlight:

* + WikiFarmStatistics - NEW MODULE. Statistics is moved to this module.
* + WikiFarmLog - NEW MODULE. It is for bots to write their logs.
* + configuration file. All configuration parameters moved to WikiFarm_config.php


* WikiFarm before 2.0 has some prerequisites. It assumes that all wikis in a farm:
** are on one server and available for one and the same db user
** have the same prefix delimeter "__" for their tables (there is a script in Additional tools directory to help with that)
